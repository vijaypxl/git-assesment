### Git Assesment


A branch `feature/add_heading` is merged to `develop` branch while you were working on
 `feature/add_jumbotron` branch which is from `develop`.
Now you have to rebase your current branch from `develop`  
so that all the updates on the `develop` branch should appear on your branch.

Do the necessary changes on your branch and later merge it to `develop`
Or create a Pull Request on github.

Merge the pull request and branch created above and at the end develop branch should have all the changes of both branches 
`feature/add_heading` and `feature/add_jumbotron`

once `develop` is ready, merge your `develop` branch into `master`


#### How to start:
Fork the repo from github
Forking means you can create a copy of that repository in your own account. 
Fork first and then do the changes and later provide me the link of your repo.

Make sure to make your repo public. 
Thanks.


Hints:
- checkout to feature branch `feature/add_jumbotron`
- rebase with develop
- Commit and push branch
- Merge to develop locally OR create a Pull request
- till here, you should have a updated development branch
- Merge develop into master
